# open_jetbrains_ide *nix replacement scripts

The scripts in this branch are intended to work alongside the primary node [application](https://github.com/grmartin/open_jetbrains_ide) to allow for simple invocation from a Linux/BSD (Mac) command line.

Simply checkout this branch and add it to your PATH and you should be ready to go (providing of course that you have open_jetbrains_ide ([GitHub](https://github.com/grmartin/open_jetbrains_ide)/[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/open_jetbrains_ide)) installed globally).
